# FirstC#App

## About && Goals
This is my first attempt at a C# application for the terminal. My goal with the application is to have a night market that tracks and gives users currency everytime they login and run it. So we're going to need to learn a few things like state , functions , etc.

I'll just keep updating the master branch instead of creating sepreate things as it's not that big at the momement(maybe that changes in the future as this project grows bigger and I see the scope increase)
